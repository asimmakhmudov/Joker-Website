                    In Gotham City, mentally troubled comedian Arthur Fleck is disregarded and mistreated by society.
                    He then embarks on a downward spiral of revolution and bloody crime. 
                    This path brings him face-to-face with his alter-ego: the Joker.
                    Arthur Fleck works as a clown and is an aspiring stand-up comic. 
                    The Joker is one of the most iconic characters in comic book history. 
                    Serving as a villain and often a nemesis for Batman across stories set in Gotham City, the DC Comics legend has never been given one singular, 
                    definitive baack story in comics. Multiple stories have blended together over the years and in different mediums, offering up versions of what might be the character's past but no one can say for sure where the character's story truly begins. Joaquin Phoenix's Joker did, however, offer up a heavy dose of insight in regards to this film's version of the Clown Prince of Gotham -- while also preserving a good bit of the mystery surrounding him.
                    In Joker, Arthur Fleck was a mentally ill resident of Gotham working as a clown and taking various jobs to make ends meet.
                    As his mental health deteriorated following several bad beats in his life (for example: getting beat up by teenagers, scolded on a bus for trying to make a kid laugh, and fired from his job), 
                    he began a descent into complete madness and developed a sort of blood lust. 
                    His first kill came on the subway in Gotham when three Wayne Enterprises employees were harassing a young woman before they turned their attention to him.
                    As Gotham begins to burn (the civil unrest starts with a garbage strike), Fleck, who has been taken as a vigilante by much of the city’s 99%, doesn’t quite know what to make of his underground cult stardom. (The city is beset by rioters in clown makeup and clown masks; because this movie is rather suddenly behind the curve in “clowns-are-scary” awareness—only Pennywise gets a special dispensation these days—these sequences look like “The Revolt of the Juggalos” or something equally laughable.) His mom (Frances Conroy, the poor woman) has been writing letters to her former employer, the magnate Thomas Wayne, and Arthur opens one of the missives and reads them, learning something disturbing.
